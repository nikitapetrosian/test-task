## Description


Welcome to service for detecting and destroying asteroids!
Now you can protect our planet by your own hands!
This project takes information from [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/), and shows you all about the asteroids that will fly near our planet.

This is test-task project, based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
